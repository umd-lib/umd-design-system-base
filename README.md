# (Libraries' Subtheme) UMD Libraries DS Theme

This theme uses the UMDDS base theme and requires the UMD Patterns module along
with [Layout Tools](https://github.com/umd-lib/umdlib-ds-layout-tools).

Also recommended is the [UMDDS Social Icons](https://github.com/umd-lib/umdds-social-icons) module.
