## Person Component

### Intro

This is the custom person component for UMD Libraries, which all person information displays on the website should use as one of the variants of this component.

### Variants

There are 3 variants of the person component:

- Bio
- List
- Card

#### Bio

[embed kitchen sink component]

The Bio variant provides detailed information about the person and should be used on standalone pages, such as profile pages in the directory.

_***Note***: The Bio description field should only contain text information with the possibility of adding links to the text. It should not contain any other components such as lists, buttons, images, etc._

#### List

[embed kitchen sink component]

The List variant provides an overview of the person and should be used on list pages, such as the directory's list page.

#### Card

[embed kitchen sink component]

The Card variant provides the least amount of information about the person. It serves as a link to the person's profile page (Bio variant) and can be used on any other pages.
