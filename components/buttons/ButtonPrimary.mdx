### Implementation Note

Currently, the disabled status wonâ€™t be included in the UMD Libraries Design System.

### Features

There are only 2 types of button will be used in the design system, which are:

- Primary - main call-to-action(hero section etc)
- Secondary - components level action(link to articles etc))

Both variants function as styled links rather than traditional buttons. Disabled states are not supported.

### Text Fields

<table>
