## Overview

Two primary link styles are used across the website:

- Title Links
- Body Links

Other UI elements, such as CTAs, navigation items, and footer links, use distinct styling patterns. Link styles are defined in `global.css` and applied directly without Single-Directory components. Body link styling is the default, while Title link styling is activated when used within heading tags (`<h1>`, etc.).

## Style Variations

While the link types differ in color, text decoration, and animation, their typography is interchangeable. For example, Title links can use any heading typography style.
