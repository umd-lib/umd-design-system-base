### Note

Currently, only 3 types of the links are included in the design system, which are:

- Titlte
- Body
- Navigation

This page showcases the **Title** link, which is used for titles with link.

### Features

The differences between the three types of links are mainly stylistic, such as color, text decoration, and animation. The typography is interchangeable within each type; for example, a Title link can be used with any title typography.

### Twig

#### Title Link

```twig
<a href={{ url }} class="link--title c-content-primary c-underline-secondary ani-underline">{{ text }}</a>
```
